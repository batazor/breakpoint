# Breakpoint - Game Plot & Narrative

## Setting

**Era**: Post-collapse medieval fantasy world  
**World**: The Fractured Lands  
**Time Period**: Year 347 After the Sundering

### The Sundering

Three and a half centuries ago, a catastrophic magical event known as "The Sundering" shattered the once-unified realm. Ancient towers of power exploded simultaneously, tearing the fabric of reality and fracturing the land into scattered hex-shaped territories. The old empire fell, magic became unstable, and survivors banded together to form new factions.

### Current State

The world has stabilized, but remains fragmented. Factions vie for control of ancient resources, rebuild civilization on the hexagonal scars of the Sundering, and seek to understand the lost knowledge that could either reunite or further divide the Fractured Lands.

## Factions

### The Kingdom of Meridian
**Leader**: Queen Aeliana the Wise  
**Philosophy**: Order through unity, diplomatic expansion  
**Strengths**: Strong economy, skilled diplomacy, advanced infrastructure  
**Weaknesses**: Bureaucratic, slow to adapt militarily  
**Territory**: Fertile plains and river valleys  

**Background**: Descendants of the old empire's nobility, the Kingdom seeks to restore order through diplomacy and economic power. They believe in rebuilding the ancient civilization with careful planning and cooperation.

**Goals**:
- Reunify the Fractured Lands under peaceful rule
- Preserve ancient knowledge and technology
- Establish trade networks between all factions
- Build grand cities rivaling the pre-Sundering era

### The Crimson Horde
**Leader**: Warlord Kargoth the Unyielding  
**Philosophy**: Strength conquers all, survival of the strongest  
**Strengths**: Fierce warriors, rapid expansion, adaptive tactics  
**Weaknesses**: Limited infrastructure, internal power struggles  
**Territory**: Mountain strongholds and contested borderlands  

**Background**: Forged in the chaos after the Sundering, the Horde consists of warriors who reject the old empire's weakness. They believe true power comes from conquest and that the strong deserve to rule.

**Goals**:
- Dominate through military might
- Control resource-rich territories
- Prove that the old empire's fall was inevitable
- Create a meritocracy where only the strong survive

### The Nomadic Tribes
**Leader**: Elder Council led by Sage Miriam  
**Philosophy**: Balance with nature, adapt and flow like water  
**Strengths**: Mobility, knowledge of terrain, sustainable living  
**Weaknesses**: Scattered settlements, limited military might  
**Territory**: Diverse biomes, following seasonal patterns  

**Background**: Rather than trying to restore the old world, the Nomads adapted to the new reality. They see the hexagonal nature of the land as a sign to live in harmony with the world's new patterns.

**Goals**:
- Maintain balance between factions
- Protect ancient natural sites
- Preserve knowledge of the pre-Sundering world
- Ensure sustainable use of resources
