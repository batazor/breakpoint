# Breakpoint

A strategy simulation game built with Godot 4.5 featuring hex-based world generation, faction management, and economic systems.

## Overview

Breakpoint is a simulation game that combines strategic gameplay elements with procedural world generation. The game features a hexagonal grid-based world, multiple factions with AI-driven behavior, dynamic economy systems, and a day-night cycle.

## Features

- **Hex Grid System**: Navigate and interact with a procedurally generated hexagonal grid world
- **Faction Management**: Multiple factions with unique behaviors and relationships
  - ✅ **NEW**: Faction relationship system (allied, neutral, hostile)
  - ✅ **NEW**: Territory and influence mechanics
  - ✅ **NEW**: Faction-to-faction interactions (trade, diplomacy, conflict)
- **AI Systems**: Advanced AI decision-making
  - ✅ **NEW**: Utility-based AI behavior trees
  - ✅ **NEW**: Resource gathering prioritization
  - ✅ **NEW**: Expansion and defense strategies
- **Economy System**: Complex economic simulation with resource management
- **AI NPCs**: Non-player characters with autonomous decision-making
- **Dynamic World**: Day-night cycle and procedural world generation
- **Build Mode**: Construction and development mechanics
- **Camera Controls**: Flexible camera system with zoom and movement
- **Player Interaction**: Tile selection, unit control, and action menus

## Controls

### Camera Controls
- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Move left
- **D**: Move right
- **Mouse Wheel Up / -**: Zoom in
- **Mouse Wheel Down / =**: Zoom out

### Interaction Controls
- **Left Click**: Select tile or unit
- **Right Click**: Open action menu for selected tile
- **B**: Toggle build mode
- **I**: Show tile/unit information
- **Space**: Pause/unpause game
- **Esc**: Cancel action, close menus, deselect units

### Unit Controls
1. **Select Unit**: Left-click on a tile containing a unit
2. **Move Unit**: After selecting, click destination tile or use action menu
3. **Deselect**: Click on empty tile or press Esc

## Requirements

- Godot Engine 4.5 or later
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/batazor/breakpoint.git
   cd breakpoint
   ```

## Key Systems

### Game Store
Central state management system that handles:
- Faction registration and management
- World state coordination
- Event signaling between systems

### Hex Grid System
Procedurally generated hexagonal grid world with:
- Terrain height generation
- Tile-based interactions
- Navigation and pathfinding

### Faction System
- Multiple competing or cooperating factions
- Unique faction behaviors and goals
- Dynamic relationships and interactions
- **NEW**: Faction relationship system (allied, neutral, hostile states)
- **NEW**: Territory control with influence mechanics
- **NEW**: Inter-faction interactions (trade, diplomacy, conflict)

### Economy System
- Resource management
- Economic simulation
- Trade and production

### AI System
- Autonomous NPC behavior
- Decision-making algorithms
- Role-based character actions
- **NEW**: Utility-based AI behavior trees
- **NEW**: Action prioritization (resource gathering, expansion, defense)
- **NEW**: Cooldown and inertia mechanics for strategic consistency

## Testing

The project includes automated tests for core systems:

```bash
# Run Faction & AI System tests
godot --headless --script scripts/tests/test_faction_ai_systems.gd

# Run River Generation tests
godot --headless --script scripts/tests/river_generation_test.gd
```

Tests are automatically run via GitHub Actions on push and pull requests.
